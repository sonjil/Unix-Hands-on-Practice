df Command
------------------------
------------------------

The Linux df command stands for "disk free". It is meant to show Linux disk space information, including disk space that is used, disk space remaining, and how filesystems are mounted on your Linux (or Unix) system. The Linux df command not only shows the free disk space on your local computer, it also shows the free disk space on all networked filesystems that are mounted by your Linux system.


$ df
Filesystem  1K-blocks   Used     Available  Use%  Mounted on
/dev/vzfs   10485760    5713424  4772336    55%   /

$ df -h

Filesystem   Size  Used  Avail  Use%  Mounted on
/dev/vzfs    10G   5.5G  4.6G   55%   /




du Command
------------------------
------------------------
The Unix and Linux du command shows information about "disk usage". Whereas the df command ("disk free") shows information about Linux filesystems, the du command shows disk usage information about only the files and directories you specify.

$ du -hs *

 60K	Burn-an-ISO
1.2M	BurnFolders
4.3M	CreateAPodcast-1
2.1M	CreateAPodcast-2
 16M	CreateAPodcast-3
2.5M	Java-Mac-Jar-Bundler
1.3M	Java-on-Mac

With that command, the -h option of the du command means "human readable" (as in "show me MB and GB"), and the -s means "only show summary information". It's important to note that this command runs in real time, so for very large directories, it can be slow to return your results.


If you're trying to find large files, sorting the output of the du command can be one approach. I find that leaving off the -h option and dealing with "block" output works better for sorting:

$ du * | sort -n
That du/sort command results in this output:

56	CreateAPodcast-1/OldCSSFiles
120	Burn-an-ISO
376	BurnFolders/images
400	Java-Mac-Jar-Bundler/images
592	BurnFolders/images-orig
616	Java-on-Mac/images
656	Java-Mac-Jar-Bundler/java-on-mac
752	BurnFolders/BurnFolders
888	CreateAPodcast-3/images-orig/external-track
896	Java-on-Mac/java-on-mac
928	CreateAPodcast-3/images-orig/joining
936	CreateAPodcast-3/images-orig/copying
1112	CreateAPodcast-3/images-orig/new-track
1136	CreateAPodcast-1/CreateAPodcast
1256	CreateAPodcast-1/L2HBackups
1336	CreateAPodcast-3/images/external-track
1352	Java-Mac-Jar-Bundler/images copy
1376	CreateAPodcast-3/images/joining
1440	CreateAPodcast-3/images/copying
1480	CreateAPodcast-2/images
1536	CreateAPodcast-3/images-orig/splitting
1616	Java-Mac-Jar-Bundler/images-old
1656	CreateAPodcast-3/images/new-track
1736	CreateAPodcast-2/CreateAPodcast
2152	CreateAPodcast-1/images/Original
2304	CreateAPodcast-3/images/splitting
2448	BurnFolders
2528	CreateAPodcast-3/images-orig/bg-track
2704	Java-on-Mac
3776	CreateAPodcast-3/images/bg-track
4208	CreateAPodcast-2
4984	CreateAPodcast-1/images
5056	Java-Mac-Jar-Bundler
7808	CreateAPodcast-3/CreateAPodcast
7944	CreateAPodcast-3/images-orig
8872	CreateAPodcast-1
12248	CreateAPodcast-3/images
32224	CreateAPodcast-3

I may not be very good at working with block size, 
but I can tell that the CreateAPodcast-3 folder is far and away the largest subdirectory in my current directory.
